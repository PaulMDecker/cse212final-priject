# Stacks
### introduction
- a stack is a Python data storage method where the last piece of data placed into the 
stack is the first ot be withdrawn and the first is the last to be withdrawn. This is known as 
Last-In/First-Out data storage. Stacks are one of the most common methods of data storage because
there are many times when you will do something, then need to reverse it.
