# tree
### Introduction
-A linked list is a data structure where data is stored in nodes, and the nodes are connected by pointers. A tree is like a linked list except that in a tree a node can be connected to multiple nodes.  



### binary tree
-A binary tree is a tree where each node only connects to two other nodes. The root of a binary tree is the node that points to other nodes and has no nodes pointing to it. A root node is also a parent node because it is pointing to other nodes. A node that is being pointed to is called a child node and the node that is doing the pointing is called a parent node. A node that has a parent node, but no child nodes is called a leaf node. A parent and its child nodes is called a subtree.

### binary search tree
-A binary search tree is a tree that has certain rules for how data is stored inside it. The data is compared to the data inside the parent tree, and if it is smaller than the parent tree, it is put in the left child node, and if it is bigger it is put in the right child node. If the tree allows duplicates, it can go in either of the child nodes.
