# 4. tree
### Introduction
-A linked list is a data structure where data is stored in nodes, and the nodes are connected by pointers. A tree is like a linked list except that in a tree a node can be connected to multiple nodes.  


### binary tree
-A binary tree is a tree where each node only connects to two other nodes. The root of a binary tree is the node that points to other nodes and has no nodes pointing to it. A root node is also a parent node because it is pointing to other nodes. A node that is being pointed to is called a child node and the node that is doing the pointing is called a parent node. A node that has a parent node, but no child nodes is called a leaf node. A parent and its child nodes is called a subtree.
### binary search tree
-A binary search tree is a tree that has certain rules for how data is stored inside it.
