# set
### Introduction
- A set is a programming data structure where the order of the objects inside does not matter because there can only be one of each piece of data without any duplicates. This means that the position of a data piece in the set can be determined by the information contained in the data piece. For example, if a set contained the numbers 1,4,7,5,3,12,15 it would look something like {1,-,3,4,5,-,7,-,-,-,-,12,-,-,15}. While this method means that you can't have any duplicates, it makes it very easy to find if a set contains a certain piece of data, you just need to go to the place where that data piece would be stored and see if it is there. The technique that allows a data piece to be stored in one index and one index only is called hashing.
