#  Python stack, set, and tree tutorial
welcome to my python tutorial. This tutorial will focus on three moderate topics:
 - [stack](cse212final-project/stack.md)
 - [set](cse212final-project/set.md)
 - [tree](cse212final-project/tree.md)

Each moduel contains a description, an example, a problem, and basic syntax for the data structure its about. you should only look at the answer to the problem after you tried to solve it.
